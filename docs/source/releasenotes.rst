Release notes
=============

The `pavics-sdi` repository only holds the documentation. Although all the individual components of the PAVICS platform are open-source, the code configuring, deploying and linking these components together is in a private repository.  We are planning to remove all sensitive material from this private repository so it can be made public. In the meantime, these release notes are the public facing information tracking the development of the platform.

1.0.0 (2019-03-20)

1.0.0-beta (2017-11-29)
