"PAVICS is a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) for climate data. It is "
"composed of modular components that together provide access to data and a"
" library of climate services. It is meant to facilitate climate data "
"analysis for both researchers and climate service providers. PAVICS is "
"not intended to be installed on individual computers, but rather on "
"servers located close to data archives."
