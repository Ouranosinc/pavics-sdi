"Here we'll cover the case where pavics-sdi is installed on more than one "
"machine and you want to balance the load across these machines. This is "
"done with `NGINX`_ and requires modifications to :file:`docker-"
"compose.yml` and creating a configuration file for the `NGINX`_ server."

"To enable load balancing, we need a proxy to redirect requests to "
"machines according to their usage. This is done by mapping proxy ports "
"(5XXXX) to the *service* ports, such as those of flyingpigeon (8093) and "
"malleefowl (8091)."

"This tell the proxy, listing on port 8093, to redirect requests to "

"sent to the same server. This is important to control since output files "
"are not automatically visible to all servers. So if for example process A"
" downloads a file from a remote server and process B subsets the file, "
"both have to be run on the same machine otherwise process B won't find "
