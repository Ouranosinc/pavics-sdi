    "    \"The simplest way to search datasets programmatically within the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is to use [`intake-esgf`](https://intake-esgf.readthedocs.io/). It works like `intake-esm`, but instead of loading a static catalog, `intake-esgf` populates its catalog by querying ESGF index nodes. There is also a new graphical search interface called [Metagrid](https://aims2.llnl.gov/search), but it does not yet federate data from all ESGF nodes.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"ESGF provides two different mechanisms to retrieve data, the legacy `Solr` index and the new `Globus` index. ESGF is decommisionning the old indexing service based on SOLR, so methods relying on it might break. `intake-esgf` works with both, so should allow for a graceful transition. \\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"What `intake-esgf` does is send search queries to a list of index nodes and aggregates the results. You can configure the list of index nodes it queries, especially since some of the nodes are very slow to respond. For this notebook, we'll query only Globus nodes to speed things up, but to ensure you find all the available data, call `intake_esgf.conf.set(all_indices=True)` to search all nodes. \"\n",
