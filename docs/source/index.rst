PAVICS is a research platform dedicated to climate analysis and visualization. It bundles
data search, analytics and visualization services. PAVICS is developped by Ouranos, CRIM and the `birdhouse`_ community and been funded by the `CANARIE`_ research software program.

To get a sense of what the platform can do, check out our `JupyterLab`_ environment.
