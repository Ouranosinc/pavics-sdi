PAVICS is a research platform dedicated to climate analysis and visualization. It bundles
data search, analytics and visualization services.

Documentation structure
-----------------------
We plan to build extensive documentation for PAVICS. We're just getting started, but please provide your comments on our `issue tracker`_.

* :doc:`Tutorials </tutorials/index>` discuss step by step how to use PAVICS. Start here to get a feeling of what can be done.

* :doc:`Installation </dev/index>` explains how to install the various components and run the system tests.

* :doc:`Process documentation </processes/index>` documents all processes available on the platform.

* :doc:`System architecture <arch/index>` describes the individual components of the system and how they work together.


PAVICS is a collection of servers, many of them developped by third parties. What you are reading is the central documentation, which should give you a good overview of each component and how they all fit together. If you're looking for documentation about one specific component, the :doc:`system architecture <arch/index>` section should include links to online docs.

PAVICS is led by Ouranos, a regional climate consortium, and CRIM, a software research institute, both located in Montreal. PAVICS borrows heavily from the `Bird-house`_ project led by the German Climate Computing Center (`DKRZ <https://www.dkrz.de/>`_) and was inspired by `UV-CDAT <https://uvcdat.llnl.gov>`_.
