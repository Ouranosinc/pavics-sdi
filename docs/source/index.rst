PAVICS is led by Ouranos, a regional climate consortium, and CRIM, a software research institute, both located in Montreal. PAVICS borrows heavily from the `Bird-house`_ project led by the German Climate Computing Center (`DKRZ <https://www.dkrz.de/>`_) and was inspired by `UV-CDAT <https://uvcdat.llnl.gov>`_.
