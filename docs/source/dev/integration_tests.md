Integration tests
=================

Notebooks found in in this repo are used as integration tests for the platform. That is, each time a change is made in the [birdhouse-deploy](https://github.com/bird-house/birdhouse-deploy) repository, the notebooks are run in the same Python environment run by the JupyterLab server.
