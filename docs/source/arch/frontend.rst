	:alt: An example of the PAVICS-frontend in action

The PAVICS-frontend (`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Ouranosinc/PAVICS-frontend>`_) is the custom graphical interface for users to leverage the services offered by the platform. It provides a map interface to display both gridded climate data and geospatial layers, launch services and workflows and monitor the progress and status of user's jobs. It also provides limited capacity to dynamically interact with datasets. Users can create projects that store datasets, workflows and outputs for future use.

The frontend is written with the React.js library and interacts with the backend through API calls to REST and WPS services. Take a look at the frontend tutorial for information on the frontend's usage.
