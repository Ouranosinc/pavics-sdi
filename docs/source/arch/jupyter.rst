====================
JupyterLab Interface
====================

A `JupyterLab`_ instance runs on the PAVICS server at `<pavics.ouranos.ca/jupyter>`_. The intent is not to run production code, but rather to demo the backend services available from a programming environment. The Python 3 engine has a number of libraries pre-installed, making it easy to experiment with web processing services and netCDF files.

Users should connect with the `public` login and the `public` password. User accounts will be available at a later time. Meanwhile, save your work elsewhere, because the user-created notebooks will be erased periodically.

A number of tutorial notebooks are available in the public directory to give a sense of how services can be  used in scientific workflows. These notebooks are tested daily against the production server.
